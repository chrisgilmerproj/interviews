Code from Interview Questions

## Notice to Readers

The code herein was written largely in response to interview questions. Under no
circumstances should this code be used to cheat on a technical interview.  It is
provided here as a reference for study and a record of questions asked.

I will note that this code is not always correct nor complete.

## Notice to Companies

I reserve the right to post any code and the corresponding questions to this repo
from any technical interview that I've been given.  Feel free to reach out to
me if you have any issues concerning this and we can discuss options.
